# ETXrealPro

##ETXrealPro -- Fork of ETXreal with pro mod intensions

> git://xreal.git.sourceforge.net / xreal/ET-XreaL 

> The plan is to try and leave most of the ETXreal code untouched for the time
being unless a change is absolutely necessary. Even if there are changes, it 
shouldn't be a problem for the ETXreaL guys to back port it into their code

> Instead the project is going to *attempt* to clone et_pro as much as is
practical. This means keeping the same cvars, cmds and inputs as we all know and
love BUT use them within the ETXreaL engine.

> This should hopefully mean an ETPro clone is created that could be used with
normal Wolf ET but if backwards compatibility needs to be broken then it will be.
ET is a bit of an old game, it needs some spicing up and this is one way to do it.

> Early days lets see :)
